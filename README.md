Setup Instructions

Clone or Download:
Clone the repository or download the project files.


File Placement:
Place all HTML and CSS files in the project root.
Create an images/ folder and add required images (e.g., Earth-Store-i3.jpg, product images).


Dependencies:
Ensure an internet connection to load Font Awesome (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css).


Run the Project:
Open any HTML file (e.g., Earth-Store.html) in a web browser to view the website.
No server setup is required as it uses static HTML and CSS.



Usage

Navigate using the top navigation bar (topnav1) with buttons (tnb1 to tnb4) linking to Home, About, Shop, and Contact.
On the Shop page, use the price filter (slider1, price-input1, price-input2) or category filters (categories-p1, categories-p2) to browse products.
On the product page, adjust quantity (quantity-counter) and add to cart (btn-add-to-cart).
On the Contact page, fill out the form (form1) or use contact details (email, phone, address).
Note: Form submission and cart functionality require backend integration (e.g., PHP, Node.js).

Customization

Styling: Modify CSS files to change colors, fonts, or layouts.
Primary color: rgb(103, 183, 103) (light green, used for buttons and accents).
Hover color: darkgreen (used for hover effects).
Secondary color: rgb(95, 95, 95) (used for text).


Content: Update text, images, or links in HTML files to match your brand or content.
Images: Replace placeholder images in the images/ folder with your own.
Animations: Adjust CSS transitions (e.g., transition: color .3s ease, transition: background-color .3s ease) for different effects.

Notes

The contact form (form1) and add-to-cart functionality (btn-add-to-cart) are static and require backend integration for functionality.
Ensure external resources (Font Awesome) are accessible, or host them locally if needed.
The project is optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Image files (e.g., Earth-Store-i3.jpg, Earth-Store-i1.png) must be present in the images/ folder for backgrounds and product displays.
